## Limitations

- **Project Data Collection**: The data collection is incomplete for the projects that are not majorly hosted in GitHub.
- [**Project Popularity Score**](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-generator#project-quality-score): The source template calls it as ***Quality***, however, I rename it as ***Popularity***. 
  > This calculation is just chosen by ***EXPERIENCE***. There is ***NO*** scientific proof that this really reflects the ***QUALITY*** of a project.
