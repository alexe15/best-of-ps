## Project Quality Score

All projects in a best-of list are ranked and sorted by a project-quality score (also called `projectrank`). The score is calculated based on various metrics automatically collected from GitHub and different package managers. The score is just a sum of points which a project collects for various aspects and metrics. The score only has a meaning when it is compared to the project-quality score of other projects. We currently use the following aspects to calculate the score:

> This calculation is just chosen by experience. There is no scientific proof that this really reflects the quality of a project.
